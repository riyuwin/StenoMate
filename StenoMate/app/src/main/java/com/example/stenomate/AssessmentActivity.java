                        "     When To Complain. You should consider making a complaint whenever you are not happy with a product and feel it has failed to measure up to its advertising claims. If there has been an error, honest and reputable merchants will generally want to know about it and will appreciate the opportunity to make an adjustment. It would be to their advantage if you would call a problem to their attention immediately.\n" +
                        "     Reliable dealers and manufacturers want to hear about the problems their customers are having with their products. They have devoted time and energy over the years to building their businesses. They value their old customers and the new ones they have won, and they sincerely want to keep them happy. They will often thank you for telling them about any problem you have had with their products.\n" +
                        "     Where To Complain. The merchant from whom you made your purchase is the best person to start with. Before you talk to the merchant, be sure you know what corrective action you plan to ask for. Then assemble all receipts and other records relating to the purchase. When you present your case to the merchant, be fair and reasonable, but definitely do not be timid.\n" +
                        "     What Next? If the merchant cannot or will not help you, you should consider complaining to the manufacturer. In most cases good manufacturers are glad to know how customers feel about their products. Most products carry the name of the manufacturer and the address of the company. Present your complaint in full in a letter. Allow several\n" +
                        "weeks for a reply so that the manufacturer can have an opportunity to, investigate your complaint.\n" +
                        "     If your letter is not acknowledged after a reasonable time and you have not been able to get any action on your complaint, you might want to consider more stringent measures. For instance, one thing you could do is write a second letter and send a copy to business agencies that are concerned with consumer affairs. The agency that most consumers think of initially is the Better Business Bureau, The bureau, which is well known for its efficiency, handles complaints without charge, but it insists that every complaint be in writing. This helps the staff to be certain that they have the facts straight before they take action on a problem.\n" +
                        "     Identifying Problems. An important consumer problem that is not easy to solve is that of the silent victim. No one can answer the question as to how many silent victims there are. Many are silent because they do not know that they have been deceived. Others do not like to admit that they were victims of a fraud. Still others do not know where to go for help.\n" +

Working at the top level of management, they must be able to keep an office running smoothly and must have the objective judgment to know when to issue orders in the boss's name. They conserve the boss's time by screening telephone calls, visitors, and correspondence. But they keep the boss well informed on all important details. They are sensitive to undercurrents in human relations and are ready to resolve internal and external problems promptly when they discover them.\n" +
                        "     A secretary has been characterized as one who can think for the boss, act for the boss, anticipate the boss's wishes, and help to increase the company's productivity.\n" +

                        "     Extensive interviews with 300 executives recently revealed that secretaries were spending almost 60 percent of their time with some of the minor operations of the business, such as handling forms, typing reports, and acknowledging general correspondence. They were spending about 10 percent of their time attending meetings and more than 15 percent making phone calls which could easily have been handled by a competent assistant. Unfortunately, only about 15 percent of their time was actually devoted to practical planning. Still, this survey clearly reveals why business executives attach so much importance to having capable secretaries and why they want responsible persons who cannot only handle the ordinary routine work but can also serve as their assistants and free their time for long-range planning, the most important part of an executives job.\n" +
